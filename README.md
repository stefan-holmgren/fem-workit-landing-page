## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to use `overflow-x: clip` instead of `overflow-x: hidden` because the page could accidentally scroll horizontally when resizing it during development.

Utilizing `:before` and `:after` pseudo-elements to create the ornaments in the sections.
